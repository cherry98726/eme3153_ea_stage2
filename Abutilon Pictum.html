                <p><b>Abutilon Pictum</b> (Gillies ex Hook. & Arn.) Walp. is an evergreen shrub of the family Malvaceae and the genus Abutilon, reaching up to 1 meter in height. The leaves are palmately lobed, with lobes that are ovate and gradually tapering, the apex long-acuminate, and the margins serrate or coarsely toothed. Both surfaces are glabrous or sparsely covered with stellate hairs on the underside. The petioles are 3–6 cm long and glabrous. The stipules are filiform and typically deciduous at an early stage.</p>
                <p>The flowers are solitary in the leaf axils, with the pedicels pendulous. The corolla is campanulate, orange-yellow, marked with purple veins, and obovate in form; the exterior surface is sparsely covered with soft hairs. The anthers are brownish-yellow, numerous, and clustered at the tip of the staminal column. The ovary is rounded at the apex and pubescent; the styles are branched and purple, with capitate stigmas.

                <p><b>Abutilon Pictum</b> is native to South American regions such as Brazil and Uruguay. It is cultivated in major cities across China, including Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, Beijing, and Liaoning. The plant prefers warm and humid climates and is not tolerant of cold. It favors full sunlight but can withstand partial shade. It grows well in fertile, moist, well-drained, slightly acidic soil, yet it is also able to tolerate relatively poor soils. Propagation is primarily carried out through stem cuttings.</p>
