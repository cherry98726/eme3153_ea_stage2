                <p><b>Tecoma Stans</b> is an evergreen shrub or small tree belonging to the family Bignoniaceae and the genus Tecoma, typically reaching a height of 4–10 meters. Young branches are smooth, hairless, and green, gradually turning brownish or slightly reddish as they mature. The leaves are opposite and imparipinnate. The inflorescences are terminal racemes bearing bisexual flowers; the calyx is fused into a cup-shaped structure with a single lobed margin. The capsules are elongated and cylindrical, with sparsely distributed small protuberances on the surface. The seeds measure about 0.6 cm in length, each end bearing a wing of similar length.</p>
