                <h4>(Plumbaginaceae)</h4>
                <p><b>Gloriosa Superba</b> L. is a climbing plant belonging to the family Colchicaceae and the genus Gloriosa. The rhizomes are tuberous and fleshy. The leaves are usually alternate, sometimes also opposite, lanceolate in shape, with the apex extended into a tail-like structure that develops into a long tendril (except for the lowermost leaves). The leaf bases possess short petioles.</p>
                <p>The perianth segments are linear-lanceolate and, due to the nodding position of the flower, curve upward. The base of each segment is narrowed and somewhat stalk-like, with wavy margins. The upper portion is bright red, while the lower portion is yellow. The anthers are linear. The style is thread-like and nearly as long as the filaments. The flowering period is from July to August.</p>
